## Dynamic Task Scheduler

#### Overview 
A Full-Stack web application designed to streamline task management through a reactive user interface and a persistent backend. This project demonstrates the integration of modern web technologies to solve organizational challenges dynamically.

### Technical Stack 
  - **Frontend:** Built with React.js, utilizing functional components and Hooks (useState, useEffect) for responsive state management.
    
  - **Backend:** Developed using Node.js and Express.js, featuring a modular API structure.
    
  - **Data Persistence:** Uses a local JSON-based database (tasks.json) to ensure task data remains consistent across sessions.
    
  - **Version Control:** Implements professional .gitignore standards to maintain repository hygiene.
    
#### Key Features
  - **Dynamic Scheduling:** Real-time updates to task lists without page reloads.

  - **RESTful API:** Custom endpoints for creating, reading, and managing task data.

  - **Modular Monorepo:** Clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend directories for scalability.
