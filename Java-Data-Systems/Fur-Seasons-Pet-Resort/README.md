# Fur Seasons Pet Resort
JavaFX Desktop Application | MVC Architecture


### **Overview**
This project is a comprehensive pet boarding and daycare management system. It was built to demonstrate the ability to handle a large-scale, professional software architecture involving complex navigation and data management.

### **How to Explore This Project**
Because this is a large project containing 90+ individual files, I have organized this directory for easy viewing:
- **FurSeasonsResort.java:** Click this to view the main entry point and GUI logic. It showcases custom JavaFX styling, image resource handling, and the primary navigation structure.
- **Project Source (ZIP):** I have included a compressed ZIP file containing the full Maven project structure, including all 20+ controllers (Billing, Reservation, Account, etc.) and the pom.xml build file.

### **Technical**
- **Architecture:** Follows a strict Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to maintain clean separation of concerns.
- **Features:**
  - **Modular Navigation:** Integrated controllers for Services, Reservations, and Accounts.
  - **Styling:** Utilizes CSS-inline styling for a "boutique resort" aesthetic.
  - **Data Systems:** Includes logic for managing pet profiles, owner information, and pricing structures.
